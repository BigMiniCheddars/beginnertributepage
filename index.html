            <p>Referred to as “the most famous astronaut since Neil Armstrong,” Colonel Chris Hadfield is a worldwide sensation whose video of David Bowie’s “Space Oddity”—seen by over 75 million people online—was called “possibly the most poignant version of the song ever created,” by Bowie himself. Acclaimed for making outer space accessible to millions, and for infusing a sense of wonder into our collective consciousness not felt since humanity first walked on the Moon, Colonel Hadfield
continues to bring the marvels of science and space travel to everyone he encounters.
In 1992, Colonel Hadfield was selected as a NASA Mission Specialist, and three years later he was aboard the Shuttle Atlantis, where he helped build the Mir space station. In 2001, on the Shuttle
Endeavour, Colonel Hadfield performed two spacewalks and in 2013, he became Commander of the International Space Station for six months off planet.
A heavily decorated astronaut, engineer, and pilot, Colonel Hadfield’s many awards include the Order of Canada, the Meritorious Service Cross, and the NASA Exceptional Service Medal. He was named the Top Test Pilot in both the US Air Force and the US Navy, and was inducted into Canada’s Aviation Hall of Fame. Colonel Hadfield is the author of three internationally best-selling books, An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth, You Are Here, and his children’s book, The Darkest Dark. Additionally, he released his musical album, Space Sessions: Songs From a Tin Can, in 2015. He is also featured on Ted.com for his talk, “What I Learned from
Going Blind in Space.” </p>
            <p>Currently, Colonel Hadfield can be seen as the cocreator and host of the internationally acclaimed BBC series Astronauts, and he is cohosting, with actor Will Smith, the National Geographic series One Strange Rock, directed by Darren Aronofsky. Colonel Hadfield is also the producer of the celebrated Rare Earth series on YouTube, and the creator of the onstage celebration Generator, which combines science, comedy, and music for sold-out audiences.
Chris believes settling on the Moon will be our next undertaking, but like all exploration we are currently limited by our technology. While some may feel impatient that we have not returned sooner, Chris sees this as a good thing, as it helps to drive us to do things we have never done before. He also says that some may not realize how far we have come in space, possibly taking for granted the fact that there are six humans permanently living off planet right now.
Chris’s philosophy for life is to not squander what you have, to
make the most of opportunities, and to take advantage of the
windows of chance that open and close around you. Chris’s
greatest source of pride is having a worthwhile impact on other people and seeing them succeed because of something he has done.
Permanently opening a door for others to pass through may be the greatest thing you ever do.
